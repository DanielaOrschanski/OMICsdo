\item{transit}{transition probability: Transition probability of the hidden Markov Chain
from the normal copy number state to either a deletion or a duplication. Is used
in the generation of the CNV_calls indicated in the first parameter.}

\item{minoverlap}{is a decimal number which indicates the needed percentage
